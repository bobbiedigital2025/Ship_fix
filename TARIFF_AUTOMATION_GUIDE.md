# Trump Tariff Control & Prediction System

## Overview

This system provides automated monitoring, prediction, and resolution for tariff-related supply chain costs, specifically designed to handle the impacts of Trump administration trade policies on American businesses.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Automated Tariff Detection
- Real-time monitoring of Trump tariff changes
- Product category tracking (electronics, textiles, automotive)
- Country-specific impact analysis (China, Mexico, Canada)

### ðŸ¤– MCP-Powered Automation
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) authentication
- Account-to-account (A2A) automated credits
- Intelligent cost mitigation strategies

### ðŸ’° Cost Mitigation Strategies
1. **A2A Credits**: Automatic customer credits for high-impact tariffs (>15%)
2. **Route Optimization**: Alternative shipping routes to avoid tariff costs
3. **Supplier Switching**: Recommendations for tariff-exempt suppliers
4. **Pricing Updates**: Automated price adjustments based on cost impacts

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### `tariff_events`
Logs all tariff changes, predictions, and impacts:
- Event type (tariff_change, prediction, impact)
- Product categories and countries
- Cost impact calculations
- Trump policy references

#### `tariff_resolutions`
Automated resolution tracking:
- Resolution types (notification, a2a_credit, route_optimization)
- MCP authentication tracking
- Cost savings calculations
- Automation status

#### `supply_chain_alternatives`
Alternative suppliers and routes:
- Trump-tariff exempt options
- Cost/quality comparisons
- Lead time analysis

## How It Works

### 1. Detection
The system monitors for:
- New Trump executive orders on tariffs
- Rate changes on existing tariffs
- Supply chain disruptions due to trade policies

### 2. Impact Analysis
When a tariff change is detected:
- Calculate percentage cost impact
- Identify affected customers
- Determine mitigation strategy

### 3. Automated Resolution
Based on impact level:
- **High Impact (>15%)**: Immediate A2A credit to customer account
- **Medium Impact (5-15%)**: Route optimization and supplier alternatives
- **Low Impact (<5%)**: Customer notification only

### 4. Tracking & Reporting
- Real-time dashboard monitoring
- Cost savings calculations
- ROI tracking for automation

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Setup Database Schema
```sql
-- Run the complete schema in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- The schema includes all tariff tables, triggers, and sample data
```

### 2. Initialize MCP Automation
```typescript
import { mcpAutomationEngine } from '@/lib/mcp-automation-engine';

// Initialize the automation engine
await mcpAutomationEngine.initialize();

// Simulate a Trump tariff event for testing
await mcpAutomationEngine.simulateTrumpTariffImpact();
```

### 3. Monitor Dashboard
- Navigate to the Supply Chain Dashboard
- View the Tariff Monitor component
- Click "Simulate Event" to test automation
- Monitor real-time resolutions and cost savings

### 4. View Results
The system automatically:
- Creates tariff event records
- Triggers appropriate resolutions
- Logs cost savings
- Updates customer accounts (A2A credits)

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Trump China Electronics Tariff
- **Event**: Trump increases China electronics tariff from 7.5% to 25%
- **Impact**: 17.5% cost increase for affected products
- **Resolution**: Automatic A2A credits + supplier switching to Vietnam
- **Result**: Customer costs mitigated, alternative suppliers identified

### Scenario 2: Mexico Automotive Tariff Threat
- **Event**: Predicted 15% tariff on Mexican auto parts
- **Impact**: 12.5% potential cost increase
- **Resolution**: Route optimization through Canada + inventory adjustment
- **Result**: Supply chain rerouted, costs minimized

### Scenario 3: Textile Import Surge
- **Event**: Trump textile tariff increases to 35%
- **Impact**: 20% cost spike on textile imports
- **Resolution**: Immediate customer credits + Bangladesh supplier switch
- **Result**: Customer relationship preserved, costs reduced

## Integration Points

### MCP Authentication
- All automated actions use MCP auth tokens
- Tracked in `mcp_auth_id` field
- Enables audit trails and compliance

### A2A Transactions
- Automatic account credits for high-impact scenarios
- Tracked in `a2a_transaction_id` field
- Integrates with billing/accounting systems

### Supply Chain APIs

- Customer satisfaction impact
- Resolution response times

### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical**: >20% tariff increase
- **High**: 15-20% tariff increase  
- **Medium**: 5-15% tariff increase
- **Low**: <5% tariff increase

## Benefits

### For Customers
- Automatic cost protection
- Transparent communication
- Minimized supply chain disruption
- Competitive pricing maintenance

### for Business
