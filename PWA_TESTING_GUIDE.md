## ðŸš€ Production Deployment

### **For PWA Distribution:**

**1. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify:**
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ folder to hosting
```

**2. Ensure HTTPS:**
- PWAs require HTTPS in production
- Vercel/Netlify provide this automatically

**3. Test Production PWA:**
- Must test on real domain with HTTPS
- localhost testing has limitations

### **For App Store Distribution:**

**Using Capacitor (Recommended):**
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npx cap init ShipFix com.bobbiedigital.shipfix
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
npm run build
npx cap sync
npx cap open ios    # Opens Xcode
